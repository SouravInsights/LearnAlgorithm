# LearnAlgorithm :computer:
**I**t's a new way of learning Algorithms. The aim of this project is to provide interactive explanations of different AI Algorithms.
## Is this project solving any problem :question:
  **B**efore I discuss about the project let me tell you about the `problems` that this project
will solve. Nowadays students are less interested to read books or attend any lectures
because somehow they find it boring or intimidating. 

`Nowadays, students are more interested to see some nice interactive explanations on the web.`
This project aims to create some good interactive explanations of AI algorithms such as
Best First Search, Natural Language Processing, Search Algorithms, Regression models
etc. basically I want to design some sort of games to explain how different algorithms
works.

## Let's see an Example: :mag_right:
### Greedy Best First Algorithm - Interactive Explanation Demo
**F**or some moments Stop thinking :thinking: about any algorithms and look at this diagram: :point_down:

![1st](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26466468/46405323-87bfa000-c725-11e8-86b5-6d021721fc87.png)

**Suppose,** you’re travelling from your **office** to your **home** and you want to reach ```as soon as possible```, then which path will 
you choose? **Think** for a while. :thinking:

**Ok,** now let's look at the next diagram: :point_down:

![2nd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26466468/46405603-5f847100-c726-11e8-9c4e-13f6ac0cc94a.png)

If I’m not wrong, you might have thought about this path, which seems the shortest among all, right?
If it is right then you’ve just tried to be `greedy`. :moneybag: 

In this way, we as a human, decide which case/path is best for us. Now let's think from an computer's perspective.
I think you all have played `Counter Strike!` **Have you ever wondered how an enemy agent finds the location of the player in the
Game World? **

This is where **Algorithms** comes into play. In games, **Best-first search** may be used as a path-finding algorithm for game characters.

For a better understanding of Greedy Best First Search Algorithm, I've created a **basic interactive game** which you might want to play to have
a better understanding. Head over to this [link](https://souravinsights.github.io/LearnAlgorithm/) and scroll down to find the game.

### Planning for future:
**As** of now, I've only created the visualization for `Greedy Best Search Algorithm`. So I'm planning to create more visualization to certain
search algorithms like: `Dijkstra's Algorithm`, `A* Algorithm`, `Depth First Search`, `Breadth First Search` and some Machine Algorithms like
`Linear Regression` etc.
